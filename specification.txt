Javascript:
I used javascript to dynamically adjust the height of the colums in my webpage by assigning the current height of the navbar
to a variable whenever the screen size is adjusted. I use this variable to make sure my webpage always perfectly takes up the size of the screen.
I also used javascript to make images glow and all other images dim when the user hovers on their respective text.


Bootstrap:
I used bootstrap's navbar feature to add an interactive navbar to my homepage, grid feature to organize my pages,
and thumbnail image feature to make my images more visually appealing.
- Used navbar tool
- Used grid tool
- thumbnail image
